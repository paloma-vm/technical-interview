# Practice Problems:
# 1) Find the k largest values in an array of n numbers. Return them in a new array sorted in decreasing order.
# 2) Given an array a of numbers and a target value t, find two numbers that sum to t (that is, a[i] + a[j] = t).
# 3) Given a list of n strings with mixed casing, return a new list of all strings that start with a capitalized letter.
# 4) Find the longest substring of unique letters in a given string of n letters.

# Restate the problem
# Ask clarifying questions
# State assumptions
# Generate sample inputs & outputs
